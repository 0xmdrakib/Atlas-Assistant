Stop doomscrolling.
Start reading *signal*.

I built **Atlas Assistant** — a calm, high-signal news portal that turns chaos into clarity.

🌍 8 focused tabs (you will get a huge internationl news in one place):
Global • Tech • Innovators • Early Signals • Great Creators • Universe • History • Faith

🧭 Filters that actually help:
Country + Topic + 1d/7d window → a feed curated by scoring + caps (no junk flood)

✨ 1 click AI Digest (for undersunding all day or weeks context in one summary):
Overview → Themes → Highlights → Why it matters → Watchlist (also you can read text-to-speech if you have less time)

🧠 Per-item AI summaries + key points
🗣️ Listen mode (text-to-speech)
🌐 Multi-language UI (almost all language are avilable)
⏱️ Updates hourly

Try it: https://atlasassistant.online

it's now fully free to use, so you can check it out ❤️.
